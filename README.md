# Electronic_Sales_EDA
## Background
An electronics company has experienced significant growth in recent years. However, with increasing competition, the management recognizes the importance of gaining deeper insights into customer behavior, product sales trends, and the impact of factors such as payment methods and shipping types on overall business success.

The company has just completed a one-year sales period from September 2023 to September 2024. A data analyst has been assigned to examine the sales transaction data collected during this period. The insights derived from the analysis are expected to optimize sales strategies, enhance customer experience, and improve customer retention and revenue.

## Problem Statement

An electronics company has experienced significant growth in recent years. However, with increasing competition, the management recognizes the importance of gaining deeper insights into customer behavior, product sales trends, and the impact of factors such as payment methods and shipping types on overall business success.

The company has just completed a one-year sales period from September 2023 to September 2024. A data analyst has been assigned to examine the sales transaction data collected during this period. The insights derived from the analysis are expected to optimize sales strategies, enhance customer experience, and improve customer retention and revenue.

## Problem Statement
### Problem Statement Explained Using the SMART Framework
1. **Specific**:
Analyze customer data to understand demographics, purchasing patterns, and product performance.

2. **Measurable**:
Success will be evaluated based on:

- Identifying top-performing products and customer ratings to determine product preferences.
- Total completed transactions.
- Categorizing customers by age, gender, and loyalty status and assessing their influence on sales types.
- The percentage of transactions involving add-ons compared to the total number of transactions.
- The impact of add-on purchases on product ratings.
3. **Achievable**:
The analysis will use sales transaction data from September 2023 to September 2024, leveraging tools such as Python and Pandas for analysis, and visualization with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. A Tableau dashboard will also be developed to support the analysis and extract meaningful insights.

4. **Relevant**:
Tailor sales and marketing strategies, improve customer ratings, maximize profits from core products and add-ons, retain loyal members, and reduce transaction cancellations.

5. **Time-bound**:
The analysis must be completed within one week.

Through a comprehensive data analysis, the company can make informed decisions on marketing, product management, sales strategies, and customer experience improvements.

## Key Questions
1. What are the central tendencies for customer age?
2. What percentage of transactions were completed compared to canceled?
3. What is the gender distribution of transactions (percentage of male vs. female customers)?
4. What percentage of customers are loyalty program members versus non-members?
5. What is the transaction percentage for each product type?
6. Is there a correlation between customer product ratings and sales volume? Do higher-rated products tend to sell more?
7. Are loyalty members more likely to purchase in larger quantities than non-members?
8. Do customers who buy add-ons tend to give higher product ratings compared to those who donâ€™t?
